# LangChain-LLM-Practice
Practice and learning repository for working with LLMs using LangChain, HuggingFace, and local models. Covers basic to advanced use-cases, prompt engineering, memory, tools, agents, and integrations.


# LangChain-LLM-Practice 

This repository contains my personal learning and experimentation with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** using **LangChain**, **HuggingFace**, and **local model setups**.

---

##  Key Concepts Explored

-  Prompt Templates & Chains
-  Local LLM integration (e.g., GPT4All, LLaMA, Falcon)
-  HuggingFace Transformers integration
-  LangChain Memory (BufferMemory, SummaryMemory)
-  Tools and Agents
-  Document loaders and vector stores
-  Embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
